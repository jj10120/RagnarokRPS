Rock Paper Scissor game
Game created using android studio for assignment to create a peer to peer game. 

The game is played by using one of the three gods that represent rock, paper or scissors to beat the CPU or other player.
Each god is based of one god from the norse mythology:
Odin = Rock
Thor = Scissors
Loki = Paper

Music in the game files belong to their original owners, I take no credit for their creation.
Songs used include: 
Waterflame, "Glorious Morning"
Bethesda Games Studio, "Skyrim Theme"
EPIC Games, "Hope Runs Deep"

The pictures of the gods and ruins image assets were available under the creative commons search on google.
